W8782 Module - 24-bit 192 kHz Stereo ADC I2S

The WM8782A is a high performance, low cost stereo audio ADC designed for recordable media applications.
The device offers stereo line level inputs along with two control input pins (FORMAT, IWL) to allow operation of the
audio interface in three industry standard modes. An internal op-amp is integrated on the front end of the chip to
accommodate analogue input signals greater than 1Vrms.

The device also has a high pass filter to remove residual DC offsets. WM8782A offers a Slave mode clocking scheme. A stereo
24-bit multi-bit sigma-delta ADC is used with 128x, 64x or 32x over-sampling, according to sample rate. Digital audio
output word lengths from 16-24 bits and sampling rates from 8kHz to 192kHz are supported.
