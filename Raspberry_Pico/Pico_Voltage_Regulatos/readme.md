**2.10. Core Supply Regulator**

RP2040 includes an on-chip voltage regulator, allowing the digital core supply (DVDD) to be generated from an external,
nominally 1.8V to 3.3V, power supply. In most cases, the regulator’s input supply will share an external power source
with the chip’s digital IO supply IOVDD, simplifying the overall power supply requirements.
